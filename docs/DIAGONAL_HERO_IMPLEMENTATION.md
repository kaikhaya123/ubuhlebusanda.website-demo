## 🚀 How It Works

### Hover Interaction
```typescript
const [hoveredSide, setHoveredSide] = useState<'left' | 'right' | null>(null)

// Left side clip-path changes:
- Default: polygon(0 0, 50% 0, 50% 100%, 0 100%)  // 50% width
- Hovered: polygon(0 0, 55% 0, 55% 100%, 0 100%)  // 55% width
- Other: polygon(0 0, 45% 0, 45% 100%, 0 100%)    // 45% width
```

### Background Images
```

Right: /images/pexels-tima-miroshnichenko-7033665.jpg (Commercial)
```

### Electrical Line SVG
```svg
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" mixBlendMode="screen">
  <linearGradient id="electricGradient">
    <!-- Amber → Yellow → Amber -->
  </linearGradient>
  <line x1="0" y1="0" x2="100" y2="100" 
        stroke="url(#electricGradient)" 
        className="animate-pulse" />
</svg>

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Electrical line not visible on some screens
**Solution**: The line uses `mix-blend-mode: screen` which works best on darker backgrounds. If needed, add a fallback color.

### Issue: Hover effect doesn't work on mobile
**Solution**: This is intentional! Mobile uses a stacked layout instead. Hover is desktop-only.

### Issue: Images loading slowly
**Solution**: Next.js Image component automatically optimizes. Ensure images are properly sized (~1920x1080 max).
